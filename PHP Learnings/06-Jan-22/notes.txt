2). Container Label

TYPES OF LABELED BLOCK IN SWITCH
1) . Case Blocks
(i) Inner Case Blocks
(ii) Outer Case Blocks
2). Default Blocks
(i) Inner Default Blocks
(ii) Outer Default Blocks
Note :: This blocks definition is optional. PHP doesn’t supports outer label blocks but inner label blocks supports. Whenever C language supports both inner label blocks and outer label blocks. The labeled block of switch allows only 256 cases in delimiters for 8-bit compiler.
Similarly, for n-bit total no. of cases = 2^n cases.

Delimiter 
A delimiter is one or more characters that separate text strings. Common delimiters are commas (,), semicolon (;), quotes ( ", ' ), braces ({}), pipes (|), or slashes ( / \ ). When a program stores sequential or tabular data, it delimits each item of data with a predefined character.
